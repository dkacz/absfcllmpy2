::: {.callout-note}
This spine pulls together the manuscript sections tracked across Milestones M8-M11. Writing issues (e.g. #68, #69, #70, #85, #86) will replace the placeholders below as those drafts land.
:::

# Abstract {#sec-abstract}

_TBD — populated by Issue #72 once the abstract draft is ready._

# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

The introduction will situate the live LLM hooks within the Caiani agent-based, stock-flow consistent (AB-SFC) model. Draft lives in Issue #85; once merged, the text slots here and will cite the methodological blueprint (@sec-methods) and stability evidence (@sec-results-hsc).

# Methods {#sec-methods}

## Model and baseline guardrails {#sec-methods-model}

- Canonical Caiani model remains intact (legacy Python 2 codebase); see `docs/blueprint.md` (§Model in brief) for the full equation map.
- Guardrails (price floor, leverage clamps, timeout fallbacks) mirror the defaults documented in `docs/blueprint.md` (§Presentation & guard defaults).
- Appendix A (Issue #74) will surface a dedicated equation-to-code table once delivered.

## Live LLM instrumentation {#sec-methods-llm}

- Python 3 Decider stub (`tools/decider/server.py --stub`) responds on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`; toggles live in `code/parameter.py`.
- Py2 client wiring is covered in `docs/methods/py2_client.md`, including timeout conversion and JSON-schema enforcement.
- Bank, firm, and wage prompts share the qualitative pattern recorded in `docs/methods/decider.md`; the cache design (Issue #68) will be summarized here when ready.
- Baseline vs LLM fallback semantics (timeouts, guard clamps, logging) are detailed in `docs/methods/fallbacks.qmd` (Issue #13).

## Simulation workflow {#sec-methods-sim}

1. Launch the Decider stub (Python 3).
2. Run the Py2 simulation (`python2 code/timing.py`) with the desired horizon (baseline OFF/ON windows = 240 ticks per PR #108).
3. Persist aggregates under `data/` and figures under `figs/`; rerun `quarto render docs` once new artifacts land.

Issue #77 will extend this section with reproducibility checklists and automation details.

# Results {#sec-results}

## Core manuscript metrics {#sec-results-core}

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

core = pd.read_csv(Path("../data/core_metrics.csv"))
# Focus on baseline OFF run for the spine summary
baseline = (
    core.query("scenario == 'baseline'")
        .pivot(index="metric", columns="scenario", values="value")
        .rename_axis(None, axis=1)
)
baseline
```

::: {.callout-tip}
A/B results will add comparative columns once Issue #69 (Results integration) lands. For now, the baseline run (seeded by PR #108) establishes the canonical reference values.
:::

## Horizon stability evidence {#sec-results-hsc}

- Horizon Stability Check (HSC) OFF run: see `docs/stability.qmd` for full commentary.
- Canonical artifacts: `data/reference/hsc_summary.csv`, `data/reference/hsc_stability_table.csv`, and the convergence plots under `figs/reference/`.

Future subsections will cover the A/B overlays, robustness sweeps, and wage/bank tables once their CSV/PNG outputs are refreshed for the 240-tick horizon.

# Discussion & outlook {#sec-discussion}

Discussion threads (limitations, policy takeaways, open questions) map to Issues #70 and #86. Once drafted, this section will cite:

- Narrative comparisons between baseline heuristics and LLM-mediated behaviours.
- Implications for macro-financial stability, tying back to the guardrails noted in @sec-methods-model.
- Future work on batch decision hooks and live LLM failover modes (tracked in blueprint roadmap).

# Appendices & companion material {#sec-appendices}

- **Appendix A (Equation map).** `docs/appendix_eq_map.qmd` (Issue #74).
- **Appendix B (JSON schemas).** Issue #75 will capture schema excerpts for firm, bank, and wage endpoints.
- **Repro Manual.** `docs/repro_manual.qmd` (Issue #77) to detail end-to-end rebuild instructions.
- **Horizon Stability Notes.** See `docs/stability.qmd` for the full OFF-run analysis previously summarised in the architect brief.

Once these pages exist, update this list with direct `@ref` cross-references so Quarto can number them alongside the main manuscript.
