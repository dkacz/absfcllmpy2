Welcome to the manuscript workspace for the live LLM project. This Quarto site collects the pages, figures, and tables described in the working outline.

- Build date: {{< meta date >}}
- For the full blueprint, see [docs/blueprint.md](blueprint.md).
- Upstream outline: `papers/outline.md`

> This site will expand as we implement the milestone tasks (M0 through M11). The landing page stays short on purpose so new sections can surface in their own `.qmd` files.
