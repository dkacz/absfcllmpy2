Welcome to the manuscript workspace for the live LLM project. This Quarto site collects the pages, figures, and tables described in the working outline.

- Build date: {{< meta date >}}
- For the full blueprint, see [docs/blueprint.md](blueprint.md).
- Upstream outline: `papers/outline.md`

> This site will expand as we implement the milestone tasks (M0 through M11). The landing page stays short on purpose so new sections can surface in their own `.qmd` files.

## Artifact conventions

For file naming, see the [Artifact Naming & Cross-Reference Conventions](conventions.md) page.

![Example overlay from `_examples`](../figs/_examples/sample_overlay.png){#fig-example-overlay}

::: {.table #tbl-example-metrics}
| scenario | metric | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | price_dispersion | 0.012 |
| llm_on | price_dispersion | 0.009 |
| baseline | inflation_volatility | 0.021 |
| llm_on | inflation_volatility | 0.017 |
:::

The table above is drawn from `data/_examples/sample_metrics.csv`; future Quarto pages should cite the CSV when narrating results (for example, “see @tbl-example-metrics”).

## Milestone M3 — Firm pricing & expectations

- [Firm pricing A/B comparison](firm_ab.qmd) — embeds Table `@tbl-firm-ab` and Figure `@fig-firm-ab` derived from the 200-tick OFF/ON runs.
