Welcome to the manuscript workspace for the live LLM project. This Quarto site collects the pages, figures, and tables described in the working outline.

- Build date: {{< meta date >}}
- For the full blueprint, see [docs/blueprint.md](blueprint.md).
- Upstream outline: `papers/outline.md`

> This site will expand as we implement the milestone tasks (M0 through M11). The landing page stays short on purpose so new sections can surface in their own `.qmd` files.

## Artifact conventions

For file naming, see the [Artifact Naming & Cross-Reference Conventions](conventions.md) page.

![Example overlay from `_examples`](../figs/_examples/sample_overlay.png){#fig-example-overlay}

::: {.table #tbl-example-metrics}
| scenario | metric | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| baseline | price_dispersion | 0.012 |
| llm_on | price_dispersion | 0.009 |
| baseline | inflation_volatility | 0.021 |
| llm_on | inflation_volatility | 0.017 |
:::

The table above is drawn from `data/_examples/sample_metrics.csv`; future Quarto pages should cite the CSV when narrating results (for example, “see @tbl-example-metrics”).

## Milestone M3 — Firm pricing & expectations

- [Firm pricing A/B comparison](firm_ab.qmd) — embeds Table `@tbl-firm-ab` and Figure `@fig-firm-ab` derived from the 200-tick OFF/ON runs.

## Milestone M4 — Bank credit & spreads

- [Bank credit A/B comparison](bank_ab.qmd) — embeds Table `@tbl-bank-ab` and Figure `@fig-bank-ab` produced by the 200-tick OFF/ON runs.

## Milestone M5 — Wage bargaining

- [Wage bargaining A/B comparison](wage_ab.qmd) — embeds Table `@tbl-wage-ab` and Figure `@fig-wage-ab` derived from the 200-tick OFF/ON runs.

## Milestone M6 — A/B runner & overlays

- [A/B overlay overview](ab_overview.qmd) — collects the firm, bank, and wage overlays (OFF dashed, ON solid, final 50 ticks shaded) produced from the `run_id=0`, `ncycle=200` runs.
- [How to reproduce A/B overlays](howto_ab.qmd) — three-step checklist (stub, `run_ab_demo`, Quarto render) for regenerating the OFF→ON artifacts.

## Milestone M7 — Experiments A/B/C (small horizon)

- [Experiment A — Wage Acceleration (Country 0)](exp_A.qmd) — `run_id=0`, `ncycle=250`; `python3 tools/generate_exp_a_demo.py` drops country 0 `upsilon` to 80 % at `t0=50` and exports `data/expA_demo/*`, `figs/expA_demo/*`.
- [Experiment B — Wage Moderation (Country 0)](exp_B.qmd) — `run_id=0`, `ncycle=250`; `python3 tools/generate_exp_b_demo.py` lifts country 0 `upsilon` to 120 % at `t0=50` and exports `data/expB_demo/*`, `figs/expB_demo/*`.
- [Experiment C — Coordinated Wage Moderation](exp_C.qmd) — `run_id=0`, `ncycle=250`; `python3 tools/generate_exp_c_demo.py` lowers all-country `upsilon` to 90 % at `t0=50` and exports `data/expC_demo/*`, `figs/expC_demo/*`.

## Appendices

- [Appendix B — JSON response schemas](appendix_schemas.qmd) — field-by-field summary of the firm, bank, and wage live-mode response schemas enforced by the Decider.
