This page describes the local **Decider** stub used during Milestone M1. The Python 3 server runs on localhost and returns deterministic placeholder decisions for the firm, bank, and wage endpoints.

## Start the server

Run the server from the repository root:

```bash
python3 tools/decider/server.py --stub
```

- Default bind: `127.0.0.1:8000`. Override with `--host` / `--port` if needed.
- The process logs requests to stdout. Leave it running while the Python 2 simulation calls it.
- To verify the binary without keeping it alive, add `--check` (starts the server in the background, hits `/healthz`, prints the result, and exits):

```bash
python3 tools/decider/server.py --stub --check
```

## Health endpoint

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz | jq
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## Stub decision endpoints

The stub mode implements three deterministic POST routes. Payloads are accepted but ignored for now; later milestones will replace these with schema validation and live LLM calls.

| Endpoint | Description | Example response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /decide/firm` | Firm pricing & expectations decision | `{ "direction": "hold", "price_step": 0.0, "expectation_bias": 0.0, "explanation": "stub: hold price; baseline heuristic" }` |
| `POST /decide/bank` | Bank loan approval & spread | `{ "approve": true, "credit_limit_ratio": 1.0, "spread_bps": 150, "explanation": "stub: approve with default spread" }` |
| `POST /decide/wage` | Worker reservation / firm wage offer | `{ "direction": "hold", "wage_step": 0.0, "explanation": "stub: no wage adjustment" }` |

Example call (firm endpoint):

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"inventory": 100, "backlog": 5}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/decide/firm
```

_Response (line-wrapped for readability):_

```json
{"direction": "hold", "price_step": 0.0, "expectation_bias": 0.0, "explanation": "stub: hold price; baseline heuristic"}
```

## Roadmap

Upcoming M1 issues extend this stub:

1. **M1-02 (Schemas):** JSON schema validation and friendly error messages.
2. **M1-03 (Cache):** Deterministic cache keyed by state hash.
3. **M1-04 (Timeout/Budget):** Server-side deadline and per-tick call budget enforcement.

Each addition will update this page so the quickstart in `AGENTS.md` always points to accurate instructions.
