# Methods Hub {#methods-index}

This hub gathers the technical documentation that underpins the live LLM instrumentation of the Caiani AB-SFC model. Use it as the starting point for detailed discussions of the architecture, runtime safeguards, data exports, and manuscript-ready metrics.

## Model Context

- [Model Overview](model_overview.md) — Non-technical summary of agents, markets, timing, and where LLM hooks integrate with the legacy Python 2 loop (@ref(methods-model-overview)).
- [Equation Map (coming soon)](eq_map.md) — Crosswalk between manuscript equations and code touchpoints (see Issue #74 for upcoming appendix content).

## Runtime Architecture

- [Decider Stub](decider.md) — Python 3 microservice that serves deterministic decisions, schema validation, and timeout controls.
- [Py2 Client](py2_client.md) — HTTP bridge from the legacy simulation to the Decider, including error taxonomy and fallback triggers.
- [Fallback Semantics](fallbacks.qmd) — Detailed explanation of guardrails, clamping rules, and logging for LLM fallbacks.
- [A/B Runner Helper](runners.md) — Convenience wrapper for producing short OFF/ON runs and pointers to the stub data bundle.

## Data & Metrics

- [Variable Dictionary](variables.md) — Metric-by-metric definitions, CSV column references, and aggregation formulas for manuscript tables (@ref(methods-variables)).
- `data/core_metrics.csv` — Canonical 240-tick baseline/LLM comparison exported by `code/timing.py`.
- `docs/stubs/` — 20-tick preview dataset (LLM OFF) for quick Quarto prototypes and smoke checks.

## Next Steps

- Coordinate with Issue #23 (M2 sign-off) once the hub and supporting pages render cleanly via `quarto render docs`.
- Update this index as additional Methods pages (e.g., caching design, wage hook instrumentation) land in later milestones.
