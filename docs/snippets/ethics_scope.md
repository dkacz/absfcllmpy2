## Ethics & Scope Disclaimer

This study uses the Caiani monetary-union agent-based stock–flow consistent codebase as a sandbox for **methodological** experimentation. The Python 2 baseline we run today inherits parameter values, simplifications, and data-handling decisions that deviate from the 2017 paper; no attempt is made to recalibrate or reproduce that original macro path. Every result we show—figures, tables, or counter summaries—should therefore be read as **illustrative evidence** of the live LLM integration pattern, not as an empirical or policy replication.

The Python 3 Decider microservice injects bounded, qualitative cues at three behavioural junctions (firm pricing, bank credit, wage decisions). Guardrails clamp every LLM suggestion to the same floors, spreads, and unit-cost rules that govern the baseline heuristics. On any timeout, schema violation, or malformed reply, the simulation falls back immediately to the legacy numeric rule and logs the reason once. These guardrails are in place to avoid overstating what an LLM can do for real-time economic decision making while still letting us probe richer narrative behaviour.

All manuscript claims must cite the generated `data/` CSVs and `figs/` PNGs produced under short demonstration runs (`run_id = 0` with horizons ≤ 250 ticks). Longer Monte Carlo sweeps remain out of scope; users who re-run them should document their own configurations. Researchers and readers should treat the resulting manuscript as a **methods guide** with reproducible assets, not as an endorsement of any specific policy outcome.
