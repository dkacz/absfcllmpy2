# Overview
Experiment B raises the wage-adjustment parameter `upsilon` for **country 0** to 120 % of its baseline value at tick `t0 = 50`. Both legs share `run_id = 0` and `ncycle = 250`; the Decider stub remains deterministic. Metrics and overlays are generated with `python3 tools/generate_exp_b_demo.py`, which writes artifacts to `data/expB_demo/` and `figs/expB_demo/`.

::: {.callout-note}
Only the wage hook for country 0 is modified. Firm pricing and bank credit continue to follow the baseline rules so the effects stem solely from the higher wage responsiveness.

## Core metrics
Table @tbl-exp-b reports wage dispersion and vacancy fill rates for the OFF and policy-on runs. Values are rendered to two decimals per the project standard.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-exp-b
#| tbl-cap: "Experiment B metrics (run 0, 250 ticks)."
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

source = Path("../data/expB_demo/expB_metrics.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(source)
ordered = (
    df.pivot(index="scenario", columns="metric", values="value")
      .reindex(["baseline", "policy_high"])
      [["wage_dispersion", "fill_rate"]]
      .rename(columns={
          "wage_dispersion": "Wage dispersion",
          "fill_rate": "Fill rate",
      })
)
formatted = ordered.applymap(lambda x: f"{x:,.2f}")
scenario_labels = {
    "baseline": "Baseline (OFF)",
    "policy_high": "Policy ON (stub)",
}
formatted.index = [scenario_labels.get(idx, idx) for idx in formatted.index]

```

## Wage-dispersion overlay
Figure @fig-exp-b displays the OFF and ON wage-dispersion series with the usual styling (OFF dashed, ON solid, final 50 ticks shaded). Tick 50 marks the point where the higher `upsilon` takes effect.

## Notes
- Artifact paths: `data/expB_demo/expB_metrics.csv`, `data/expB_demo/expB_wage_dispersion_series.csv`, `figs/expB_demo/expB_wage_dispersion_overlay.png`.
- Generator: `python3 tools/generate_exp_b_demo.py` (`RUN_ID=0`, `NCYCLE=250`, `t0=50`).
- Stub behaviour dampens the ON leg to the guard rails; live prompts will inject heterogeneity once M6-LIVE scenarios run.
