  Abstract
  -----------
  We present an Agent-Based Stock Flow Consistent Multi-Country model of a Currency Union
  to analyze the impact of changes in the fiscal regime of member countries, that is permanent
  changes in the deficit-to-GDP targets that governments commit to comply. Simulations are per-
  formed under three scenarios differentiated for the number of member countries. The parametric
  configuration of the model yields economically reasonable values for the dynamics of key variables,
  broadly comparable with historical data and available stylized facts, in particular for the Euro Area
  which constitutes the natural point of reference of our work. Our policy experiments show that
  fiscal expansions generally allow to improve the dynamics of real GDP, labor productivity, and em-
  ployment, though being associated with higher levels of public debt. On the contrary, permanent
  fiscal contractions have always strong recessive effects and tend to be self-defeating exacerbating
  real GDP volatility both in the short and long run, when the Currency Union includes a higher
  number of countries and the dimension of international trade increases. The observed increase of
  average debt-GDP ratios in these scenarios is mainly caused by the raise of public debt-to-GDP in
  poorer and less productive countries, which is mirrored by a reduction of the countriesâ€™ net foreign
  asset position.

  How to Run
  ------------

  Simulations are run interpreting the timing.py file which represents the simulation time schedule, thus
  timing.py is the 'main' of the code.
  In the file parameter.py are saved the model's parameters.
  Aggregate Data are saved in a data folder that is created automatically. While individual firms' and banks' data
  are saved if the printAgent parameter is equal to 'yes'
